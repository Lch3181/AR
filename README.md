# SNHU AR Video Player
Description:

A project me and Mike https://github.com/MikeSemicolonD did for SNHU during the summer of 2018. The purpose of the project was to use Unity and Vuforia to create an application that would scan image target and play videos pertaining to those targets.

The prototype is compatible with iOS, Android and Windows.

Works with Unity 2019.2.9f1

Functions:

Play video on click (works on Windows OS and IOS, but IOS cannot go back to AR camera after video is done)

Show PDF on click (currently only works on Windows OS)

interact with 3D objects (only tested on Windows OS and IOS)

3D animation (only tested on Windows OS and IOS)
