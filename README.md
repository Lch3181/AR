# SNHU AR Video Player
Description:

A project me and Mike https://github.com/MikeSemicolonD did for SNHU during the summer of 2018. The purpose of the project was to use Unity and Vuforia to create an application that would scan image target and play videos pertaining to those targets.

The prototype is compatible with iOS, Android and Windows.
